# Fifa_Challenge2018
Repository for the Fifa Challenge 2018 where the aim is to predict the World Cup 2018 Winner

In this code, the FIFA World Cup 2018 is simulated from pre quarter final stages onwards. We used teams offensive and defesnive stats (source:https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/world-cup-2018) to measure their net goal scoring capabilities & then simulate the match result using poisson distribution. We calculate win probabilities using the method explained before and after than run several Monte Carlo simulations to decide the most likely semi-finalists and the most likely winner.
